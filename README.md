# Web-Scraping---Extract-Product-reviews-from-Amazon-Flipkart

# Flipkart & Amazon Review Scraper

This is a small web application developed to extract customer reviews from a specified Flipkart or Amazon product page using web scraping tools like Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Playwright. It features a FastAPI backend, a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend, and is deployed using Docker containers.

---

## Goals

1. Automatically extract product reviews (name, rating, comment, date, location) from Flipkart or Amazon.
2. Support pagination to access reviews across multiple pages.
3. Provide a RESTful API and an easy-to-use web interface.
4. Route all incoming requests via FastAPI backend.
5. Automatically detect the platform (Flipkart/Amazon) based on the input URL.
6. Perform headless scraping within Docker containers.
7. Enable navigation between pages using Previous/Next buttons in the frontend.
8. Display extracted reviews on a dynamic HTML page.

---

## Tech Stack & Methodology

* The backend simulates browser interactions to click on "All reviews" or similar links and extract data from multiple paginated pages.

**Flipkart**: Selenium + BeautifulSoup

**Amazon**: Playwright (requires login session)

## Solution Approach

### Flipkart Scraping Workflow

1. The user provides a Flipkart product URL through the HTML form.
2. The backend appends the page number (default is 1) to support pagination.
3. It detects whether the URL is from Flipkart or Amazon.
4. Opens the product URL in a Selenium-driven browser.
5. Searches for and clicks on the "All Reviews" link.
6. Constructs the paginated review URL, such as:

   ```
   https://www.flipkart.com/fossil-machine-analog-watch-men/product-reviews/itmeg9efbhqazq6s?pid=WATEG9EFHDYXH83N&lid=LSTWATEG9EFHDYXH83N1FH0F7&marketplace=FLIPKART&page=2
   ```

````
7. Parses the review page using BeautifulSoup to extract the total number of review pages.
8. Extracts each review's details (name, rating, date, comment, location) from the HTML elements.
9. Returns a JSON response with reviews, total pages, and the current page number.
10. Displays the data dynamically in the web UI.

### Setup Instructions (Flipkart)

**Pre-requisites:**
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Internet access to install dependencies

**Steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuchitraKadolkar/Web-Scraping---Extract-Product-reviews-from-Amazon-Flipkart.git
cd https://github.com/SuchitraKadolkar/Web-Scraping---Extract-Product-reviews-from-Amazon-Flipkart.git
docker-compose up 
````

**Access:**

* Frontend UI: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Backend API: [http://localhost:9000/api/extract-reviews](http://localhost:9000/api/extract-reviews)

---

### Amazon Scraping Workflow

1. Amazon requires a logged-in session to avoid CAPTCHA and anti-bot mechanisms.
2. Save a session using Playwright with `headless=False`.
3. Accept product URL and page number via terminal.
4. Open the product page in a Playwright-controlled browser.
5. Locate and click the "See more reviews" link.
6. Click on Next page button until we match provided page number.

   ```
   https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PQDFCL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
   ```

````
7. Use Playwright selectors to extract review data from each page.
8. Return the data in JSON format.

### Setup Instructions (Amazon)

**Pre-requisites:**
- Python 3.13.x installed
- Internet access for dependency installation

**Steps:**
```bash
cd backend/app/routers/amazon
./setup.sh  # It will install necessary packages

# Save Amazon login session
python amazon_login.py  # Manually log in, then press Enter to save session

# Start review extraction
python amazon_scraper.py  # Enter URL and page number when prompted
````

---

## Limitations

1. Amazon limits the visible reviews on the website to 10 pages.

   * To access all reviews, consider using the official Amazon Product Advertising API.
2. Amazon enforces strong anti-bot mechanisms.

   * Headless scraping may not always respect persistent sessions. It's recommended to use `headless=False` mode during login and scraping.

---

## Notes

* The system detects the e-commerce platform dynamically from the input URL.
* Docker ensures consistent environment setup and isolated dependencies.
* The frontend is intentionally kept simple for ease of integration and testing.

Then the part about sealing it and having it build pressure was about two sentences long and I wasn't even sure if it was working right. The tip about turning off the Stay Warm features was an afterthought at the back of the pamphlet but that's a critical thing to know when you can't figure out why it's not cooking!\n\nUsually any type of cooking appliance comes with a recipe book, but none here! Fortunately there are TONS of recipes online that are very easy to follow. And it was in the beef stew recipe I found that they explained what the Stay Warm setting was, how to turn it off, and how to release the pressure when the cooking is done.\n\nLOTS of trial and error to get it cooking the first time.

That 3 up there is generous.\n\nThis Instant Pot Duo V6 (emphasis on the V6, it\'s so new that there aren\'t even proper reviews for it yet) was my first ever pressure cooker. I was drawn to the slimmer design and the cheaper price. It seemed like a good bang for the buck. And, it probably is.\n\nThe problem is that a nip and tuck doesn\'t unstick a float valve, which has seemed to be a common problem since Instant Pot inception. I\'m not talking about the vent/seal knob. That\'s fine. I\'m talking about the small metal valve next to the float valve.\n\nThe Instant Pot instructions will tell you to do a water test to make sure everything is fine. 3 cups of water, vent knob to seal, 10 minutes of pressure, quick release and go. My float valve popped up clean as a whistle. Which was supposed to happen, because it was new. But ultimately this was misleading. It\'s not a sufficient context of use. You know what is? Cooking actual food.\n\nSo I\'ve cooked pasta and beans, a brothy Korean soup, alfredo fettuccine, a second water test, and a chunky chicken soup. Not once did the float valve pop up and seal the device by itself, other than the two water tests. Steam came out in plumes and plumes from it, for over 2 minutes. The veggies in the soups were mushy, and the two pasta dishes were charred to the bottom of the pot. It didn\'t even deliver a burn warning; it was still "pre-heating"! Cue the scrubbing. I didn\'t bother trying to press the sides of the lid down to help it seal, because why should I? It\'s 2023. It\'s electric. It should seal by itself -- but didn\'t.\n\nI have returned this Duo V6 and will purchase an Instant Pot Pro.
